A Docker Image For R + Jekyll
=============================

We can use R + Jekyll for purposes like blogging in R Markdown, as explained in [knitr-jekyll](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-jekyll).
But setting an environment for that is a little hard. Hope this Docker image make it painless.

## Usage

```sh
$ docker pull yutannihilation/r-jekyll
```
